  <h4>
        I am a queer fashion model born and raised in Dallas Texas. I'm currently 22 residing in San Marcos where I study 
Digital media and innovation. I consider myself to being one of the up-and-coming queer representators.
In the Queer community one is usually forced to pick a side between being feminine or masculine. This conceptual way of thinking derives from the heterosexual relationship, enforcing “normality” within their lifestyle. By limiting ourselves to appease heterosexual concepts we are blindingly stripping the freedom from our queer community from expressing our authentic selves.  It doesn’t matter who you are, it’s ok to be masculine, feminine or even both. I have battled with expressing myself in this way since high school. I had friends who would say I had feminine features or I did certain stuff that was feminine so I would try to be as masculine as one could be. I also had friends who would say that I was becoming too manly so of course I would try to insert feminine behavior back into my life. In college I actually bought a wig and wore it around campus because at that point I could care less about what anyone had to say but of course it brought a lot of unwanted attention. I wanted to try it out, I wanted to finally express that side of me without holding anything back. I feel like after I was able to find love and happiness in my being, I ascended to a new level of comfort within my body. There isn’t a soul on this planet who can walk in your shoes. Once you are able to accept yourself for who you are the world will start to look much different.

       WHO AM I?
  </h2>
  </p>
  
<p>
  <h4>
    I am a dancer in the ballroom community. My style of dance lies within the vogue elements. Ballroom allows me to express myself in ways that I would normally
    supress in my everyday life. Ballroom gave my life a purpose and a loving family who are likeminded people coming from different backgrounds to be accepted 
    by those around them. I fell in love with voguing around march but I didn't actually get good until around august, that's when I was able to make sense of how
    to correctly use the elements.
